## What is Yeoman?

Yeoman is an open source project which defines an opinionated stack for web application development. It includes a golden bundle of tools and frameworks, provided with documentation and authority. Our aim is to help developers quickly build beautiful web apps. For more details on project features, see [yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io).

## A note on repos

The Yeoman org has a number of repos. This one is for the main project codebase, yeoman/yeoman.io contains the site content designed by B-Reel as well as the current holding page (the content of which can be seen on [http://yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io)). Should you require access to other repos, feel free to ask Paul or Addy and we'll sort that out.
