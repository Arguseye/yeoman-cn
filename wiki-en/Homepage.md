## Why use Yeoman?

With so many great tools available to front-end web developers these days it can sometimes be difficult to understand how they all fit together. Deciding on a workflow that you’re happy with is often a very personal endeavour, but getting started isn’t always easy. Yeoman aims to solve this problem by scaffolding workflows for creating modern webapps, while at the same time mixing in many of the best practices that have evolved within the industry. 

## Yeoman

Our workflow is comprised of three tools for improving your **productivity** and **satisfaction** when building a web app: *yo* (the scaffolding tool), *grunt* (the build tool) and *bower* (for package management).

<ul class="tools-list">
<li class="yoyo"><a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yo">yo</a> scaffolds out a new application, writing your Grunt configuration and pulling in relevant Grunt tasks and Bower dependencies that you might need for your build.</li>

<li class="gruntjs"><a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> is used to build, preview and test your project, thanks to help from tasks curated by the Yeoman team and grunt-contrib. </li>

<li class="bower"><a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a> is used for dependency management, so that you no longer have to manually download and manage your scripts.</li>
</ul>

All three of these tools are developed and maintained separately, but work well together as part of our prescribed workflow for keeping you effective.

## Getting started

### Installation

A complete [getting started](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started) guide is available but for those looking to get up and running quickly, make sure you have installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [Git](http://git-scm.org) and optionally, [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install) (if you plan to use Compass).

Then install the required tools globally by running:

```
npm install -g yo
```

This will install _Grunt_ and _Bower_ automatically. 

**Pro-tip:** A [5 Minute Introduction Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=zBt2g9ekiug) to Yeoman is available if you're a little more visually inclined :)

`yo` can generate several types of applications, but it needs help from plug-ins, or [generators](http://yeoman.io/community-generators.html) to get the job done. To scaffold a web application, you'll need to grab the web app generator:

```
npm install -g generator-webapp
```

**Note:** Many generators no longer require this installation step and will automatically install yo, grunt and bower just by installing the generator directly.

You can install additional generators with npm. For example, to install the [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) generator: `npm install -g generator-angular`. Run `yo` for more information.

**Pro-tip:** Looking for a tutorial? We're happy to recommend [Building apps with the Yeoman workflow](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/building-apps-with-the-yeoman-workflow/) on NetTuts.

### Usage

A complete workflow might look like this:

```sh
yo webapp                      # scaffold out a skeleton web app project
bower install underscore       # install a dependency for your project from Bower
grunt                          # build the application for deployment
```

Or with the AngularJS generator:

```sh
npm install -g generator-angular  # install generator
yo angular                        # scaffold out a AngularJS project
bower install angular-ui          # install a dependency for your project from Bower
grunt test                        # test your app
grunt serve                       # preview your app (formerly `grunt server`)
grunt                             # build the application for deployment
```

## Migrating from earlier versions

If you were previously using Yeoman 0.9.x, you may have noticed a few things have changed. A [migration guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Migrate-from-0.9.6-to-1.0) is available to help you move over to 1.0. We've also written up some of the [reasons](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/The-Road-to-1.0) behind our move. 

## Contributing

We are more than happy to accept external contributions to the project in the form of feedback, [bug reports](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman) and even better - pull requests. 

At this time we are primarily focusing on improving the user-experience and stability of Yeoman for our 1.0 beta release. Please keep this in mind when submitting feature requests, which we're happy to consider for future versions.
